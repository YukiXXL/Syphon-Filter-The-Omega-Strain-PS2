# Syphon-Filter-The-Omega-Strain-Codes
A Github page where the PS2 cheat codes could be stored.

I was thinking about creating a codes for PS2 version for Syphon Filter 4: The Omega Strain and maybe even make a server.
Codes would be for public use and include all variants if possible (NTSC(USA), PAL(EU), Demo(USA); Public Beta 1,2).
